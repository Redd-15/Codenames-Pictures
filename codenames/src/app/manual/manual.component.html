              What are these strange symbols on the map? Codes for locations
              where spies must contact secret agents!
            </p>
            Two rival spymasters know the agent in each location. They deliver
            coded messages telling their field operatives where to go for
            clandestine meetings. Operatives must be clever. A decoding mistake
            could lead to an unpleasant encounter with an enemy agent - or
            worse, with the assassin! Both teams race to contact all their
            agents, but only one team can win.

              Once in a room, split up into two teams - red and blue - of
              similar size and skill. You need at least four players (two teams
              of two) for a standard game.

            <p>
              Each team chooses one or more players to be their spymaster. The

              Once in the game, operatives will see a grid of 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;5

              locations where the field operatives can meet agents.

            Spymasters will also see the same symbols with colour coding that

              Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. The word relates to
              one or more pictures in the grid. The field operatives try to
              guess which pictures their spymaster meant.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a field operative touches a picture, a guess button appears.
              When this button is clicked, a guess is made, and it is revealed
              who is in that location. If it is one of their team's agents, the
              operatives may keep guessing locations related to that one-word
              clue. Otherwise, it is the other team's turn.
            </p>
            The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.

            <div class="subtitle">Taking turns</div>
            Teams take turns, beginning with the starting team. On your team's
            turn, a spymaster gives <b>one clue</b>, and the field operatives
            may make <b>multiple guesses</b>.
            <div class="subtitle">Giving a clue</div>
            If you are a spymaster, your job is to think up a clue that relates
            to some of the pictures your team is trying to guess. Your clue
            consists of one word that relates to those pictures and one number
            that tells how many of your pictures relate to that word. You are
            allowed to give a clue for only one picture but it's fun to try for
            two or more. Getting four pictures with one clue is a big
            accomplishment.
            <div class="example">
              <div>For instance, <b>steam: 3</b> is a good clue for the cards below.</div>
              <div class="cards">
                <div class="card"><img src="cards/card-269.jpg"></div>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Making contact</div>
            When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to
            figure out what it means. The operatives indicate their official
            guess when one of them clicks the guess button on one of the
            pictures. The colour of the selected card is revealed.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the field operative selects a picture belonging to his or her
                team, the operatives may continue making guesses (but they do
                not get another clue).
              </li>
              <li>
                If the field operative touches the location with the assassin,
                this ends the game. The team that contacted the assassin loses.
              </li>
              <li>Otherwise, the turn ends here.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="subtitle">Ending the turn</div>
            Your team's turn always has exactly one clue and one or more
            guesses. If the operatives' first guess is one of their team's
            pictures, they may make a second guess. If that's correct, they may
            make another guess, and so on. The turn ends
            <ul>
              <li>if they guess a picture that's not theirs,</li>
              <li>
                if they choose to not guess anymore by pressing the
                <i>End guessing</i> button,
              </li>
              <li>
                or if they have already made as many guesses as the number
                specified by the clue (the number of remaining guesses is
                displayed in the game prompt).

              You might have received several clues for which you did not get

              It is possible to win on the other team's turn if they guess your

              Your clue should be one word, no spaces. It must be about the
              pictures, not about the patterns that cards make on the table or
              the letters in certain words.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can allow your operatives to guess as many pictures as they
              want by selecting <b>?</b> instead of a number. This is especially
              helpful if you have given clues for multiple pictures that your
              team has not guessed yet. The disadvantage is that the field
              operatives don't know how many pictures relate to the newest clue.
              The advantage is that they may guess as many pictures as they
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are allowed to use <b>0</b> as the number part of your clue.
              This means that none of your team's agents relate to that clue. If
              the spymaster gives 0 as the number, the usual limit on guesses
              does not apply.
